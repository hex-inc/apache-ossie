# Ossie ↔ Hex converter

Bidirectional, offline conversion between
[Apache Ossie](https://ossie.apache.org/) and
[Hex](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/connect-to-data/semantic-models/semantic-authoring/modeling-specification).

- **Export** (`ossie-hex export`): Ossie → Hex
- **Import** (`ossie-hex import`): Hex → Ossie

A Hex semantic project is a directory of YAML resource files (models and views).
This converter maps an Ossie semantic model to/from that layout.

During export, datasets and fields become models and dimensions, relationships
become per-model relations, and metrics become per-model measures. Import
performs the reverse conversion.

**Hex → Ossie → Hex is lossless<sup>†</sup>.** The reverse is not.

<sup>†</sup> Lossless in the semantic sense. Syntactic sugar may be lost, but
the underlying SQL is preserved.

Invalid input raises a `ConversionError`. Anything Hex cannot represent is
reported as a warning rather than dropped quietly.

## Installation

This converter is distributed as a Python package. Install it with `uv` or
`pip`:

```bash
uv tool install ossie-hex

# Alternatively
pip install ossie-hex
```

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

## Usage

### Command line

#### `export`

Convert an Ossie semantic model into a Hex semantic project.

```bash
ossie-hex export -i <file> -o <directory> \
  [--model <name>] \
  [--base-model <dataset>] \
  [--dialect <dialect>]
```

Options:

- `-i, --input <file>` — Required. Ossie YAML file to export.
- `-o, --output <directory>` — Required. Directory where Hex YAML files are
  written.
- `--model <name>` — Optional. Ossie semantic model to export. If omitted, the
  first model is exported and a warning is emitted when the document contains
  multiple models.
- `--base-model <dataset>` — Optional. Dataset to receive metrics that cannot be
  attributed to a single dataset.
- `-d, --dialect <dialect>` — Optional. Ossie dialect to pick from Ossie
  expressions. If omitted, the dialect the document declares is used, falling
  back to `ANSI_SQL`.

Example:

```bash
ossie-hex export -i model.yaml -o hex_project/ \
  --model revenue \
  --base-model orders \
  --dialect snowflake
```

#### `import`

Convert Hex semantic project resource files into Ossie YAML.

```bash
ossie-hex import -i <directory> --dialect <dialect> \
  [-o <file>] \
  [--name <name>]
```

Options:

- `-i, --input <directory>` — Required. Directory containing the Hex YAML files.
- `-d, --dialect <dialect>` — Required. Ossie dialect the project's SQL is
  written in. A Hex project does not record one, so the converted expressions
  can only be tagged with what you supply here, and it becomes the document's
  declared dialect.
- `-o, --output <file>` — Optional. Ossie YAML output file. If omitted, output
  is written to stdout.
- `--name <name>` — Optional. Name to assign to the imported Ossie model. If
  omitted, the project directory name is used.

Examples:

```bash
# Write Ossie YAML to a file
ossie-hex import -i hex_project/ -o model.yaml \
  --dialect snowflake \
  --name my_model

# Write Ossie YAML to stdout
ossie-hex import -i hex_project/ --dialect snowflake
```

### Python API

```python
from ossie import OSIDialect
from ossie_hex import convert_hex_to_ossie, convert_ossie_to_hex

ossie_yaml, warnings = convert_hex_to_ossie(
    hex_files,  # {file name: YAML str}
    dialect=OSIDialect.ANSI_SQL,
    model_name="my_model",
)

hex_files, warnings = convert_ossie_to_hex(ossie_yaml)  # {file name: YAML str}
```

## Problems

Conversion raises a `ConversionError` when the process cannot produce reasonable
output:

In Hex → Ossie,

- The Hex project directory is missing or contains no YAML resources.

In Ossie → Hex,

- The Ossie file is missing.
- Compiled Hex resource fails validation.
- Unique identifiers that normalize to the same Hex ID.
- Metrics cannot be assigned to a model and `--base-model` is not given.
- Custom extension data is malformed.

Conversion emits a `ConversionWarning` when the output is lossy:

- [Concepts](#concepts) that are supported in one format but not the other.
- [Data types](#data-types) that are not one-to-one.

## Conversion

### Concepts

The table below shows how Ossie and Hex concepts correspond, and where a concept
in one format has no direct equivalent in the other. Backticks identify literal
fields in each format. Where a concept exists in Hex but is not supported in
Ossie, then data is preserved in the `HEX` custom extension on import. Where a
concept exists in Ossie but is not supported in Hex, then data is omitted on
export.

### Data types

Data types translate between the two formats as follows, with notes where
conversion is not one-to-one.

| Ossie `datatype` | Hex `type`        | Notes                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `String`         | `string`          |                                                      |
| `Decimal`        | `number`          |                                                      |
| `Integer`        | `number`          | Returns as `Decimal`.                                |
| `Float`          | `number`          | Returns as `Decimal`.                                |
| `Boolean`        | `boolean`         |                                                      |
| `Date`           | `date`            |                                                      |
| `DateTime`       | `timestamp_naive` |                                                      |
| `DateTimeTz`     | `timestamp_tz`    |                                                      |
| `Opaque`         | `null`            | Preserved in the `HEX` custom extension.             |
| `Opaque`         | `other`           |                                                      |
| `Time`           | `other`           | No Hex equivalent.                                   |
| _omitted_        | `string`/`number` | Warning. String for dimensions, number for measures. |

### Custom extension

Hex features that Ossie cannot express are preserved in an Ossie custom
extension (vendor name `HEX`) so they survive a round trip. The extension data
is a JSON object. Data contents are versioned with a key at the document's
top-level custom extensions field. The keys used at each scope are listed below.

| Scope          | Keys                                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Semantic Model | `extension_version`, `views`                                                       |
| Dataset        | `display_name`, `source_kind`, `visibility`, `dimensions`, `measures`, `relations` |
| Field          | `type`, `visibility`, `expr_sql`                                                   |
| Metric         | `model_id`, `measure_id`, `display_name`, `type`, `visibility`, `semi_additive`    |
| Relationship   | `relation_type`, `visibility`                                                      |
